    "<p style=\"font-size:12pt\">Soccer has its origins in 1863 in England. Since then, soccer became famous all over the world  (Murray & Murray, 1998, pp. 1–4). The Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) was funded in 1904 and is the world soccer’s governing body. The first World Cup of men took place in 1930 in Uruguay (Dunmore, 2015, p. vii) with Uruguay as the first world champion. The men's world cup in Russia in 2018 is the 21th holding. The first women's world cup took place in 1991 in China, since today seven world cups have been held [1]. However, women’s soccer was banned in the past. In Germany for example, women's soccer was banned from 1955 to 1970 [2]. A reason for that was the assumption that women's soccer is unfeminine, the womanlike grace would disappear and the women's body and soul would suffer from playing soccer.<br></p>    \n",
    "<p><span style=\"font-size:12pt\">This project analyses the differences of male and female soccer players. Therefore, the extracted data from Wikipedia, Google API and YouTube API is analyzed to measure the popularity of female and male soccer players. The research question is stated in the following chapter and the third chapter describes the data collection and methods used to answer the research questions. The fourth chapter provides the findings from the python programming and existing related work is presented in chapter five.</span><br></p>\n",

As you can see, most soccer players are stated in the left bottom square (up to 50 caps and a value up to 500 for Google Trends search results.) To analyse the results, different aspects have to be considered firt. For example, a name like 'Thomas Müller' is a common name in Germany and some soccer players from Brazil, like 'Marta' (female team captian of Brazil) or 'Jefferson' (male goalkeeper of Brazil), are only named with the prename. The results from 'Jefferson' might be distorted, because you might also get results from Thomas Jefferson (lived from 1743 to 1826), who was an American Founding Father and was the third U.S. president [6]. Another important consideration, that might influence the results, is the fact, that the analysis of the Google Trends data was conducted before the men's World Cup in Russia in 2018 after the list of players for all teams have been announced.

    "       <p><span style=\"font-size:12pt\">The World Cup in 2011 brought women’s soccer high attention in the United States as the Americans defeated Brazil in a penalty kick shootout after Abby Wambach scored the tying goal in the 122nd minute. LeFeuvre et al. (2013) uses match-level data from the Women's Professional Soccer League (WPS) to study the effect of the World Cup on WPS attendances. The WPS existed during 2009 and 2011, a new professional leage was founded in 2013 and is called National Women’s Soccer League [5]. LeFeuvre et al. found out that the 2011 Women’s World Cup roughly doubled the attendances at women’s professional soccer matches. For the analysis they used an empirical strategy similar to those of Jewell and Molina (2005) and Lawson, Sheehan, and Stephenson (2008). LeFeuvre et al. (2013) used match-level data from the 2009-2011 WPS seasons to estimate the following model:</span></p><br>\n",
    "<img src=\"LeFeuvre.png\" height=\"450\" width=\"650\" border=\"2\" align=\"bottom\" hspace=\"50\" vspace=\"50\">\n",
    "<p><span style=\"font-size:12pt\">The attendances were obtained from the WPS website. <i>PostWC</i> is the primary variable of interest and taking a value of one for all matches after the World Cup final on July 17, 2011. <i>𝛽1</i> will be positive if the WC led to increased attendance at WPS matches. <i>DuringWC</i> could have either a positive or a negative coefficient. This variable takes a value of one for matches played while the World Cup. <i>DuringWC</i> will be positively related to Attendance if the WC led to an increase in WPS attendance before the conclusion of the World Cup and will be negative if fans substituted televised World Cup matches for live WPS events.</span><br></p>\n",
    "<p><span style=\"font-size:12pt\">Other factors might affect attendance e.g. the amount of rain that falls on the day of the match. To control other factors the model includes Precip and dummy variables for the years 2009 and 2011. <i>InaugGame</i> for the inaugural WPS match and DoubleHeader for a match played as part of a double header with an MLS club. To control the quality of the teams playing in each match LeFeuvre et al. (2013) defined two variables <i>HomePtsPct</i> and <i>VisitPtsPct</i>. These variables are defined as the number of points earned by the home team and the visiting team as a percentage of the possible points that each team could have earned in its previous matches that season. For the day of the week or the month of the year on which each match was played LeFeuvre et al. (2013) defined the vector <i>DayMonth</i>. One would expect matches played on weekdays to have lower attendance than matches played on a weekend.

    "        <p><span style=\"font-size:12pt\">Mutz et al. (2014) has investigated how public attention for individual players of different national soccer teams is influenced by (a) their athletic performance and (b) their physical attractiveness. The results show that public interest in soccer players depends significantly on performance and attractiveness. There is no gender-specific difference: the attractiveness of male soccer players is just as important for popularity as it is for female soccer players.\n",
    "Mutz et al. (2014) has set up four hypotheses:</span></p>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "   <li><span style=\"font-size:12pt\">H#1: The better an athlete’s sporting performance, the higher the public interest in her/him </span></li>\n",
    "   <li><span style=\"font-size:12pt\">H#2: The more attractive an athlete is, the higher the public interest in her/him.</span></li>\n",
    "   <li><span style=\"font-size:12pt\">H#3: Any effect of attractiveness on public interest should be stronger for female athletes than for male athletes.</span></li>\n",
    "   <li><span style=\"font-size:12pt\">H#4: Particularly the combination of strong sporting performance and high physical attractiveness results in high popularity.</span></li><br>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "<p><span style=\"font-size:12pt\">Mutz et al. (2014) has measured the popularity of the celebrity by the frequency with which the person is looked up on the Internet search engine Google and collected the Google search requests for male and female soccer players from six national teams. He used the period of the last men’s and women’s UEFA (Union of European Football Associations) European Championship in soccer, in June 2012 and July 2013 and only considered the search requests coming from the respective national country. Mutz et al. (2014) selected three men’s national teams (Germany, Spain, Italy) and three women’s national teams (Germany, Sweden, France) for the empirical analysis. \n",
    "In order to measure the performance of athletes Mutz et al. (2014) relied on two indicators:</span></p>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "   <li><span style=\"font-size:12pt\">performance differences could be seen in differing lengths of time on the pitch</span></li>\n",
    "   <li><span style=\"font-size:12pt\">Those players shooting goals are particularly put in the media’s spotlight and receive much public attention</span></li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "<p><span style=\"font-size:12pt\">Next were the attractiveness of a player’s face according to the truth-of-consensus method measured. The attractiveness score was calculated as the mean value of the six attractiveness evaluations. The evaluation was conducted by three male and three female students on a seven-grade rating scale.\n",
    "The results obtained by Mutz et al. (2014) show that the performance significantly affects the public attention the players of a team receive. The goals scored are more important for public attention. Public attention depends on the attractiveness of soccer players: the more attractive the person is evaluated as, the greater the attention is. Attractive players are more in the focus of the public than less attractive team members, regardless of pitch time and goal-scoring. The popularity differences of the male and female soccer players depend on attractiveness to a similar extent. The attractiveness effect does not depend on gender. The public interest in soccer players from different national teams, as measured by Google requests at the UEFA European Championship for men and women, depends largely on the performance on the pitch and the physical attractiveness of a player. Attractiveness influences public awareness for both male and female soccer players.\n",

    "Berichterstattungsdifferenzen</span></b><br>\n",
    "        <p><span style=\"font-size:12pt\">Schöndorfer's (2014) article aims to be able to make up-to-date statements about the persistence or the change in the representation of female footballers in selected German print media. Of interest here is the extent to which traditional or novel representations of footballers are present. According to the purpose of this article, the research question was:\n",
    "How were female footballers participating in the Women's World Cup 2011 shown in selected German newspapers during the period of this sporting event?\n",
    "In order to be able to answer this question, theoretical aspects must be summarized in advance on the basis of the following topics:</span></p>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "   <li><span style=\"font-size:12pt\">Formal features</span></li>\n",
    "   <li><span style=\"font-size:12pt\">Verbal content</span></li>\n",
    "   <li><span style=\"font-size:12pt\">Visual content</span></li>\n",
    "   <li><span style=\"font-size:12pt\">Linguistic and stylistic characteristics</span></li>\n",
    "   <li><span style=\"font-size:12pt\">Formal features</span></li>\n",
    "   <li><span style=\"font-size:12pt\">Sporting values</span></li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "<p><span style=\"font-size:12pt\">The goal of analyzing content and visual representations of women footballers in relevant media contributions was pursued by means of the content analysis method. It is an empirical method for the systematic, intersubjectively comprehensible description of content and formal features of messages. The answer to the research question is based on a review of the relevance of previously stated statements on media portrayals of women athletes, which are assigned to just these five subject areas. In principle, both a quantitative and a qualitative procedure are suitable for this empirical investigation: the collection of relevant media contributions results in an unexpectedly large number of analysis units (N = 478). In order to be able to take them all into account, the quantitative approach can be used, with which a large number of data can be analyzed and presented clearly. The second part of the research objective, the determination of whether or to what extent new forms of representation of women footballers exist, could be achieved more with a qualitative approach. With the development of a category system, all contents relevant to an empirical investigation, called categories, are defined, collected and defined. Quantitative content analysis categories are based on previously developed theoretical statements and are developed prior to data collection, which is why in the context of quantitative content analysis they are generally closed category systems that are not altered during data collection.\n",
    "Results of the empirical study of 478 contributions to the media show that - for the relevant subject of the study and the period under consideration - theoretical assumptions do not dominate traditional media representations of female footballers, but rather that predominantly new types of representation occur. Although the progression of gender equality in media football happens much more in the evolutionary, rather than in the pace of revolution, the results of the empirical study show that positive changes in the sense of progressive emancipation are very noticeable and that there is a changing consciousness , Even sports and football - two of the most backward media areas in terms of gender democracy - do not stop at this necessary social transformation.</span></p>\n",
